## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to racial and gender inequalities. More specifically, I am considering analyzing data regarding discrimination in housing and/or income in the United States as well as the effects of living in an urban or rural environment. By studying these issues more closely, I hope to gain insight into how we can provide more affordable and equitable housing and decrease the current wage gaps.

## Proposal
Does the proportion of Black Covid cases increase depending on the location within the United States? In this study, I plan to examine the disproportionate impact
of COVID-19 on Black communities in the United States. I hypothesize that southern states will have larger numbers of cases and deaths for Black citizens due to the relaxed restrictions in southern states such as Florida and Texas during the pandemic as well as historical racial discrimination in conservative southern states. I will be using data collected by Data for Black Lives that extracted data from state websites that reported covid-19 infections and deaths by race. My explanatory variable is location which indicates the state that the cases/deaths were reported. The outcome variable is the percent of Black cases out of total cases in a given state. After running my regression, if there is correlation between state and cases that depicts a trend by geographic region, then my hypothesis can be supported. If there is no correlation between state and cases or there is no variation between states in the south and states in the north for example, then my hypothesis will be disproved.
