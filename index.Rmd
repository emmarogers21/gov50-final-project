## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to racial and gender inequalities. More specifically, I am considering analyzing data regarding discrimination in housing and/or income in the United States as well as the effects of living in an urban or rural environment. By studying these issues more closely, I hope to gain insight into how we can provide more affordable and equitable housing and decrease the current wage gaps.
